how<00:01:35.560><c> to</c><00:01:35.759><c> even</c><00:01:36.119><c> make</c><00:01:36.320><c> it</c><00:01:37.240><c> so</c><00:01:37.560><c> I</c><00:01:37.640><c> looked</c><00:01:37.880><c> at</c><00:01:38.000><c> the</c>

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
how to even make it so I looked at the
 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.910 align:start position:0%
how to even make it so I looked at the
experimental<00:01:38.799><c> section</c><00:01:39.119><c> in</c><00:01:39.280><c> the</c><00:01:39.520><c> paper</c><00:01:40.520><c> and</c><00:01:40.680><c> it</c>

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
experimental section in the paper and it
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.429 align:start position:0%
experimental section in the paper and it
actually<00:01:41.200><c> seemed</c><00:01:41.600><c> surprisingly</c><00:01:42.360><c> simple</c><00:01:43.280><c> all</c>

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
actually seemed surprisingly simple all
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.870 align:start position:0%
actually seemed surprisingly simple all
I<00:01:43.600><c> had</c><00:01:43.720><c> to</c><00:01:43.840><c> do</c><00:01:44.079><c> was</c><00:01:44.240><c> two</c><00:01:44.520><c> basic</c><00:01:44.960><c> steps</c><00:01:45.640><c> where</c>

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
I had to do was two basic steps where
 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.950 align:start position:0%
I had to do was two basic steps where
the<00:01:46.079><c> first</c><00:01:46.320><c> one</c><00:01:46.600><c> was</c><00:01:46.759><c> to</c><00:01:46.880><c> treat</c><00:01:47.280><c> almost</c><00:01:47.680><c> any</c>

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
the first one was to treat almost any
 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.870 align:start position:0%
the first one was to treat almost any
kind<00:01:48.159><c> of</c><00:01:48.360><c> wood</c><00:01:48.719><c> using</c><00:01:49.040><c> some</c><00:01:49.360><c> commonly</c>

kind of wood using some commonly

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
available chemicals and then after that
 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.429 align:start position:0%
available chemicals and then after that
I<00:01:53.240><c> just</c><00:01:53.399><c> had</c><00:01:53.600><c> to</c><00:01:53.719><c> squish</c><00:01:54.079><c> it</c><00:01:54.200><c> and</c><00:01:54.360><c> heat</c><00:01:54.600><c> it</c><00:01:55.320><c> this</c>

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
I just had to squish it and heat it this

dense and strong piece of wood that was
 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.469 align:start position:0%
dense and strong piece of wood that was

original piece the only problem was that
 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.389 align:start position:0%

even<00:02:05.799><c> though</c><00:02:05.960><c> it</c><00:02:06.079><c> seemed</c><00:02:06.520><c> really</c><00:02:07.280><c> simple</c><00:02:08.280><c> I</c>

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
even though it seemed really simple I
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.910 align:start position:0%
even though it seemed really simple I
didn't<00:02:08.720><c> really</c><00:02:08.920><c> know</c><00:02:09.200><c> exactly</c><00:02:09.640><c> how</c><00:02:09.759><c> to</c><00:02:09.920><c> do</c><00:02:10.119><c> it</c>

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
didn't really know exactly how to do it
 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.110 align:start position:0%
didn't really know exactly how to do it
I<00:02:11.000><c> mean</c><00:02:11.200><c> for</c><00:02:11.360><c> the</c><00:02:11.520><c> first</c><00:02:11.840><c> part</c><00:02:12.239><c> I</c><00:02:12.360><c> was</c><00:02:12.560><c> totally</c>

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
I mean for the first part I was totally
 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.990 align:start position:0%
I mean for the first part I was totally
fine<00:02:13.800><c> and</c><00:02:13.920><c> I</c><00:02:14.080><c> had</c><00:02:14.360><c> everything</c><00:02:14.680><c> that</c><00:02:14.800><c> was</c>

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
fine and I had everything that was
 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.509 align:start position:0%
fine and I had everything that was

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
chemicals the second part was the issue
 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.350 align:start position:0%

though<00:02:20.519><c> because</c><00:02:20.720><c> I</c><00:02:20.840><c> had</c><00:02:21.040><c> no</c><00:02:21.319><c> idea</c><00:02:21.959><c> how</c><00:02:22.120><c> I</c><00:02:22.239><c> was</c>

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
though because I had no idea how I was

while heating it at the same time to do

this I figured that I was going to need

this I figured that I was going to need

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
some sort of press thing and my first

some sort of press thing and my first

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
thought was to get something like a
 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.990 align:start position:0%
thought was to get something like a

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%

that about an hour was a good time so I

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
just left it there and over the next
 

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.190 align:start position:0%

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
hour the color of the water slowly
 

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.030 align:start position:0%

plate it was a bit slow and clunky but I

the only difference was that it was way

towel<00:14:54.720><c> I</c><00:14:54.800><c> then</c><00:14:54.959><c> started</c><00:14:55.279><c> crushing</c><00:14:55.639><c> it</c><00:14:55.839><c> again</c>

00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
towel I then started crushing it again
 

00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:59.430 align:start position:0%
towel I then started crushing it again
and<00:14:56.680><c> so</c><00:14:57.160><c> far</c><00:14:58.160><c> I</c><00:14:58.279><c> was</c><00:14:58.519><c> really</c><00:14:58.759><c> happy</c><00:14:59.199><c> with</c><00:14:59.320><c> how</c>

00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
and so far I was really happy with how
 

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.230 align:start position:0%
and so far I was really happy with how
it<00:14:59.560><c> was</c><00:14:59.759><c> going</c><00:15:00.680><c> unlike</c><00:15:01.079><c> with</c><00:15:01.199><c> my</c><00:15:01.399><c> hands</c><00:15:02.079><c> the</c>

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
it was going unlike with my hands the
 

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.110 align:start position:0%
it was going unlike with my hands the
Press<00:15:02.480><c> was</c><00:15:02.639><c> doing</c><00:15:02.959><c> a</c><00:15:03.199><c> way</c><00:15:03.440><c> better</c><00:15:03.759><c> job</c><00:15:03.959><c> at</c>

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
Press was doing a way better job at
 

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.470 align:start position:0%
Press was doing a way better job at
squishing<00:15:04.600><c> it</c><00:15:05.199><c> and</c><00:15:05.360><c> it</c><00:15:05.680><c> did</c><00:15:05.880><c> seem</c><00:15:06.120><c> like</c><00:15:06.240><c> it</c><00:15:06.360><c> was</c>

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
squishing it and it did seem like it was
 

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.790 align:start position:0%
squishing it and it did seem like it was
a<00:15:06.600><c> lot</c><00:15:06.839><c> easier</c><00:15:07.680><c> than</c><00:15:07.880><c> squishing</c><00:15:08.320><c> a</c><00:15:08.480><c> normal</c>

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
a lot easier than squishing a normal
 

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.269 align:start position:0%
a lot easier than squishing a normal
piece<00:15:09.000><c> of</c><00:15:09.199><c> wood</c><00:15:10.160><c> this</c><00:15:10.279><c> also</c><00:15:10.519><c> made</c><00:15:10.800><c> sense</c>

00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
piece of wood this also made sense
 

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:13.430 align:start position:0%
piece of wood this also made sense
because<00:15:11.680><c> as</c><00:15:11.800><c> I</c><00:15:11.920><c> mentioned</c><00:15:12.360><c> earlier</c><00:15:13.160><c> with</c><00:15:13.320><c> a</c>

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
because as I mentioned earlier with a
 

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.389 align:start position:0%
because as I mentioned earlier with a

lot of the lignan and hemicellulose
 

00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:18.269 align:start position:0%
lot of the lignan and hemicellulose
removed<00:15:16.160><c> there</c><00:15:16.279><c> was</c><00:15:16.440><c> a</c><00:15:16.639><c> lot</c><00:15:16.800><c> more</c><00:15:17.079><c> empty</c><00:15:17.519><c> space</c>

00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
removed there was a lot more empty space
 

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:20.470 align:start position:0%
removed there was a lot more empty space
and<00:15:18.440><c> a</c><00:15:18.639><c> lot</c><00:15:18.920><c> less</c><00:15:19.160><c> holding</c><00:15:19.560><c> the</c><00:15:19.720><c> cellulose</c>

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
and a lot less holding the cellulose
 

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.790 align:start position:0%
and a lot less holding the cellulose
together<00:15:21.240><c> so</c><00:15:21.440><c> with</c><00:15:21.560><c> some</c><00:15:21.800><c> added</c><00:15:22.160><c> pressure</c>

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
together so with some added pressure
 

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.949 align:start position:0%
together so with some added pressure
these<00:15:23.079><c> empty</c><00:15:23.480><c> spaces</c><00:15:24.000><c> were</c><00:15:24.279><c> all</c><00:15:24.480><c> supposed</c><00:15:24.800><c> to</c>

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
these empty spaces were all supposed to
 

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:27.150 align:start position:0%
these empty spaces were all supposed to
start<00:15:25.279><c> collapsing</c><00:15:26.199><c> and</c><00:15:26.320><c> I</c><00:15:26.399><c> think</c><00:15:26.560><c> the</c><00:15:26.720><c> paper</c>

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
start collapsing and I think the paper
 

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.509 align:start position:0%
start collapsing and I think the paper
again<00:15:27.920><c> included</c><00:15:28.399><c> some</c><00:15:28.639><c> really</c><00:15:29.079><c> interesting</c>

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
again included some really interesting
 

00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:32.030 align:start position:0%
again included some really interesting

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
what I showed before and this was
 

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.389 align:start position:0%
what I showed before and this was

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
hopefully how my wood currently looked
 

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:39.150 align:start position:0%
hopefully how my wood currently looked

00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
other hand is what I was trying to do to
 

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:43.509 align:start position:0%
other hand is what I was trying to do to
it<00:15:41.480><c> and</c><00:15:41.759><c> again</c><00:15:42.600><c> there</c><00:15:42.759><c> was</c><00:15:42.880><c> a</c><00:15:43.079><c> massive</c>

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%

00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
increase its strength but anyway I then
 

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:05.230 align:start position:0%
increase its strength but anyway I then
just<00:16:03.399><c> continued</c><00:16:03.880><c> crushing</c><00:16:04.240><c> the</c><00:16:04.399><c> wood</c><00:16:04.920><c> hoping</c>

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
just continued crushing the wood hoping
 

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.189 align:start position:0%
just continued crushing the wood hoping
that<00:16:05.360><c> it</c><00:16:05.480><c> would</c><00:16:05.880><c> eventually</c><00:16:06.440><c> end</c><00:16:06.639><c> up</c><00:16:06.800><c> like</c><00:16:07.040><c> the</c>

00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
that it would eventually end up like the
 

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:10.189 align:start position:0%
that it would eventually end up like the

it looked like some of the wood was

00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
pulling on the trigger and I was really
 

00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:26.750 align:start position:0%
pulling on the trigger and I was really
hoping<00:22:24.840><c> to</c><00:22:24.960><c> see</c><00:22:25.159><c> the</c><00:22:25.320><c> pellet</c><00:22:26.320><c> just</c><00:22:26.520><c> get</c>

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
hoping to see the pellet just get
 

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.350 align:start position:0%
hoping to see the pellet just get
deflected<00:22:27.320><c> like</c><00:22:27.480><c> the</c><00:22:27.640><c> screwdriver</c>

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
deflected like the screwdriver
 

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.549 align:start position:0%
deflected like the screwdriver
one<00:22:30.159><c> two</c>

00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
one two
 

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:35.310 align:start position:0%

three<00:22:33.559><c> however</c><00:22:34.039><c> that</c><00:22:34.360><c> wasn't</c><00:22:34.720><c> at</c><00:22:34.880><c> all</c><00:22:35.120><c> what</c>

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
three however that wasn't at all what
 

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.830 align:start position:0%
three however that wasn't at all what
happened<00:22:36.080><c> and</c><00:22:36.200><c> it</c><00:22:36.279><c> was</c><00:22:36.600><c> almost</c><00:22:37.080><c> comical</c><00:22:37.640><c> how</c>

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
happened and it was almost comical how
 

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.430 align:start position:0%
happened and it was almost comical how
bad<00:22:38.039><c> it</c><00:22:38.240><c> was</c><00:22:39.200><c> the</c><00:22:39.360><c> high-speed</c><00:22:39.799><c> footage</c><00:22:40.159><c> that</c><00:22:40.279><c> I</c>

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
bad it was the high-speed footage that I
 

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.710 align:start position:0%
bad it was the high-speed footage that I
got<00:22:40.840><c> was</c><00:22:41.039><c> also</c><00:22:41.520><c> completely</c><00:22:42.440><c> pointless</c><00:22:43.440><c> and</c><00:22:43.559><c> I</c>

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
got was also completely pointless and I
 

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.310 align:start position:0%
got was also completely pointless and I
was<00:22:43.919><c> kind</c><00:22:44.039><c> of</c><00:22:44.240><c> embarrassed</c><00:22:44.799><c> that</c><00:22:44.919><c> I</c><00:22:45.000><c> had</c><00:22:45.120><c> even</c>

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
was kind of embarrassed that I had even
 

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.789 align:start position:0%
was kind of embarrassed that I had even
set<00:22:45.559><c> it</c><00:22:45.760><c> up</c><00:22:46.760><c> I</c><00:22:46.880><c> then</c><00:22:47.000><c> looked</c><00:22:47.200><c> at</c><00:22:47.320><c> the</c><00:22:47.440><c> footage</c>

00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:47.799 align:start position:0%
set it up I then looked at the footage
 

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:49.390 align:start position:0%
set it up I then looked at the footage
from<00:22:47.960><c> the</c><00:22:48.120><c> camera</c><00:22:48.440><c> that</c><00:22:48.520><c> was</c><00:22:48.679><c> pointing</c><00:22:49.039><c> at</c><00:22:49.200><c> the</c>

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
it and it had apparently just exploded
 

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.070 align:start position:0%
it and it had apparently just exploded
it<00:22:55.520><c> really</c><00:22:55.720><c> didn't</c><00:22:56.000><c> look</c><00:22:56.279><c> like</c><00:22:56.400><c> it</c><00:22:56.520><c> had</c><00:22:56.720><c> even</c>

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
it really didn't look like it had even
 

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.149 align:start position:0%
it really didn't look like it had even
attempted<00:22:57.559><c> to</c><00:22:57.679><c> stop</c><00:22:57.960><c> the</c><00:22:58.120><c> pellet</c>

00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
attempted to stop the pellet
 

00:22:59.159 --> 00:23:01.789 align:start position:0%
attempted to stop the pellet
and<00:22:59.320><c> this</c><00:22:59.440><c> was</c><00:22:59.720><c> honestly</c><00:23:00.159><c> pretty</c><00:23:00.440><c> sad</c><00:23:00.640><c> to</c><00:23:00.840><c> see</c>

00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
and this was honestly pretty sad to see
 

00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:03.590 align:start position:0%
and this was honestly pretty sad to see
especially<00:23:02.320><c> after</c><00:23:02.520><c> spending</c><00:23:03.000><c> thousands</c><00:23:03.360><c> of</c>

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
especially after spending thousands of
 

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.029 align:start position:0%
especially after spending thousands of

00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
dollars and waiting for months to try
 

00:23:06.039 --> 00:23:08.590 align:start position:0%
dollars and waiting for months to try
this<00:23:07.039><c> what</c><00:23:07.200><c> also</c><00:23:07.360><c> made</c><00:23:07.520><c> it</c><00:23:07.679><c> even</c><00:23:07.960><c> sadder</c><00:23:08.480><c> was</c>

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
this what also made it even sadder was
 

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.310 align:start position:0%
this what also made it even sadder was
that<00:23:08.760><c> this</c><00:23:08.919><c> pelet</c><00:23:09.279><c> gun</c><00:23:09.799><c> was</c><00:23:10.000><c> over</c><00:23:10.400><c> 16</c><00:23:10.960><c> times</c>

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
that this pelet gun was over 16 times
 

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.789 align:start position:0%
that this pelet gun was over 16 times
weaker<00:23:12.159><c> than</c><00:23:12.400><c> one</c><00:23:12.559><c> of</c><00:23:12.720><c> the</c><00:23:12.960><c> weakest</c><00:23:13.400><c> real</c><00:23:13.880><c> guns</c>

00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
weaker than one of the weakest real guns
 

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:17.710 align:start position:0%
weaker than one of the weakest real guns
so<00:23:15.440><c> it</c><00:23:15.600><c> wasn't</c><00:23:15.919><c> even</c><00:23:16.279><c> remotely</c><00:23:17.000><c> close</c><00:23:17.559><c> to</c>

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't even remotely close to
 

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.029 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't even remotely close to
being<00:23:18.000><c> able</c><00:23:18.200><c> to</c><00:23:18.320><c> stop</c><00:23:18.640><c> a</c><00:23:18.760><c> real</c><00:23:19.080><c> bullet</c><00:23:19.679><c> and</c><00:23:19.880><c> at</c>

00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
being able to stop a real bullet and at
 

00:23:20.039 --> 00:23:22.630 align:start position:0%
being able to stop a real bullet and at
this<00:23:20.480><c> point</c><00:23:21.480><c> things</c><00:23:21.760><c> weren't</c><00:23:22.159><c> exactly</c>

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
this point things weren't exactly
 

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.510 align:start position:0%
this point things weren't exactly
looking<00:23:23.120><c> good</c><00:23:24.120><c> at</c><00:23:24.240><c> the</c><00:23:24.360><c> same</c><00:23:24.600><c> time</c><00:23:24.960><c> though</c><00:23:25.400><c> I</c>

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
looking good at the same time though I
 

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.750 align:start position:0%
looking good at the same time though I

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
was very aware that this was only my
 

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.789 align:start position:0%
was very aware that this was only my

00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0%
first attempt and that the piece that
 

00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:32.590 align:start position:0%
first attempt and that the piece that
IID<00:23:30.039><c> made</c><00:23:31.039><c> wasn't</c><00:23:31.520><c> exactly</c><00:23:32.039><c> the</c><00:23:32.200><c> highest</c>

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
IID made wasn't exactly the highest
 

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.190 align:start position:0%
IID made wasn't exactly the highest
quality<00:23:33.559><c> this</c><00:23:33.679><c> was</c><00:23:33.880><c> made</c><00:23:34.159><c> very</c><00:23:34.480><c> clear</c><00:23:34.760><c> to</c><00:23:34.880><c> me</c>

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
quality this was made very clear to me
 

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.029 align:start position:0%
quality this was made very clear to me
when<00:23:35.320><c> it</c><00:23:35.520><c> had</c><00:23:35.799><c> spontaneously</c><00:23:36.600><c> fallen</c><00:23:37.000><c> in</c><00:23:37.279><c> half</c>

00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
when it had spontaneously fallen in half
 

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:39.870 align:start position:0%
when it had spontaneously fallen in half
and<00:23:38.200><c> there</c><00:23:38.320><c> was</c><00:23:38.679><c> obviously</c><00:23:39.120><c> a</c><00:23:39.279><c> lot</c><00:23:39.480><c> of</c><00:23:39.640><c> room</c>

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
and there was obviously a lot of room
 

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.350 align:start position:0%
and there was obviously a lot of room
for<00:23:40.360><c> improvement</c><00:23:41.360><c> also</c><00:23:42.120><c> I</c><00:23:42.320><c> was</c><00:23:42.640><c> still</c><00:23:43.039><c> really</c>

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
for improvement also I was still really
 

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.149 align:start position:0%
for improvement also I was still really
impressed<00:23:43.960><c> by</c><00:23:44.120><c> how</c><00:23:44.279><c> well</c><00:23:44.520><c> it</c><00:23:44.640><c> had</c><00:23:44.760><c> blocked</c><00:23:45.039><c> the</c>

00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
impressed by how well it had blocked the
 

00:23:45.159 --> 00:23:47.909 align:start position:0%
impressed by how well it had blocked the
screwdriver<00:23:46.120><c> and</c><00:23:46.240><c> in</c><00:23:46.400><c> my</c><00:23:46.640><c> mind</c><00:23:47.360><c> this</c><00:23:47.559><c> proved</c>

00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
screwdriver and in my mind this proved
 

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:50.190 align:start position:0%
screwdriver and in my mind this proved
that<00:23:48.039><c> it</c><00:23:48.159><c> had</c><00:23:48.320><c> the</c><00:23:48.440><c> hardness</c><00:23:49.279><c> to</c><00:23:49.600><c> potentially</c>

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
that it had the hardness to potentially
 

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.470 align:start position:0%
that it had the hardness to potentially
block<00:23:50.520><c> a</c><00:23:51.000><c> projectile</c><00:23:52.000><c> so</c><00:23:52.679><c> I</c><00:23:52.760><c> figured</c><00:23:53.120><c> that</c><00:23:53.320><c> all</c>

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
block a projectile so I figured that all
 

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.990 align:start position:0%
block a projectile so I figured that all
I<00:23:53.640><c> had</c><00:23:53.760><c> to</c><00:23:53.919><c> do</c><00:23:54.240><c> was</c><00:23:54.480><c> somehow</c><00:23:54.840><c> make</c><00:23:54.960><c> it</c><00:23:55.320><c> stronger</c>

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
I had to do was somehow make it stronger
 

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.669 align:start position:0%
I had to do was somehow make it stronger
and<00:23:56.240><c> stop</c><00:23:56.520><c> it</c><00:23:56.679><c> from</c><00:23:57.080><c> exploding</c><00:23:58.080><c> and</c><00:23:58.240><c> I</c><00:23:58.520><c> had</c>

00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
and stop it from exploding and I had

though this was a very simple change but
 

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.149 align:start position:0%
though this was a very simple change but

I really felt that it would make a huge

00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
with that being said the first thing
 

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.750 align:start position:0%
with that being said the first thing
that<00:24:36.960><c> I</c><00:24:37.039><c> was</c><00:24:37.159><c> going</c><00:24:37.240><c> to</c><00:24:37.399><c> have</c><00:24:37.520><c> to</c><00:24:37.640><c> do</c><00:24:38.159><c> was</c><00:24:38.399><c> treat</c>

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
that I was going to have to do was treat
 

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.110 align:start position:0%
that I was going to have to do was treat
it<00:24:39.320><c> and</c><00:24:39.440><c> I</c><00:24:39.559><c> did</c><00:24:39.880><c> pretty</c><00:24:40.080><c> much</c><00:24:40.360><c> the</c><00:24:40.520><c> exact</c><00:24:40.880><c> same</c>

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
it and I did pretty much the exact same
 

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.590 align:start position:0%
it and I did pretty much the exact same

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
thing as before because I didn't think
 

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.310 align:start position:0%
thing as before because I didn't think
anything<00:24:44.039><c> really</c><00:24:44.440><c> went</c><00:24:44.720><c> wrong</c><00:24:45.000><c> with</c><00:24:45.159><c> this</c>

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
anything really went wrong with this
 

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.830 align:start position:0%
anything really went wrong with this
chemical<00:24:45.720><c> step</c><00:24:46.679><c> the</c><00:24:46.799><c> only</c><00:24:47.080><c> thing</c><00:24:47.279><c> that</c><00:24:47.399><c> I</c><00:24:47.520><c> did</c>

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
chemical step the only thing that I did
 

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.029 align:start position:0%
chemical step the only thing that I did

00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
slightly different this time was that I
 

00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:52.789 align:start position:0%
slightly different this time was that I
used<00:24:50.279><c> a</c><00:24:50.440><c> much</c><00:24:50.640><c> bigger</c><00:24:51.080><c> Beaker</c><00:24:52.080><c> and</c><00:24:52.200><c> I</c><00:24:52.399><c> held</c><00:24:52.640><c> it</c>

00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
used a much bigger Beaker and I held it

used a much bigger Beaker and I held it

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
left with a wet block of wood it looked
 

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.870 align:start position:0%
left with a wet block of wood it looked

the first attempt and the only
 

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.830 align:start position:0%
the first attempt and the only

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
difference was that it was bigger and I
 

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.669 align:start position:0%
difference was that it was bigger and I

00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
loaded it into the hydraulic press this

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
where to put it I would also use a ruler
 

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.110 align:start position:0%
where to put it I would also use a ruler

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
to confirm the final placement of it and
 

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.669 align:start position:0%
to confirm the final placement of it and
this<00:25:52.320><c> was</c><00:25:52.600><c> very</c><00:25:52.880><c> different</c><00:25:53.159><c> than</c><00:25:53.480><c> last</c><00:25:53.720><c> time</c>

00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
this was very different than last time
 

00:25:54.679 --> 00:25:57.870 align:start position:0%
this was very different than last time
where<00:25:54.919><c> I</c><00:25:55.159><c> just</c><00:25:55.320><c> centered</c><00:25:55.760><c> it</c><00:25:55.960><c> entirely</c><00:25:56.559><c> by</c><00:25:56.880><c> eye</c>

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
where I just centered it entirely by eye
 

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
where I just centered it entirely by eye

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
with the in place though I then started
 

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.269 align:start position:0%
with the in place though I then started
lowering<00:26:00.559><c> the</c><00:26:00.679><c> upper</c><00:26:01.039><c> plate</c><00:26:01.799><c> and</c><00:26:01.960><c> this</c><00:26:02.080><c> was</c>

00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
lowering the upper plate and this was
 

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:04.510 align:start position:0%
lowering the upper plate and this was
now<00:26:02.520><c> the</c><00:26:02.720><c> moment</c><00:26:03.559><c> that</c><00:26:03.679><c> I</c><00:26:03.799><c> was</c><00:26:04.000><c> hoping</c><00:26:04.320><c> the</c>

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
now the moment that I was hoping the
 

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.870 align:start position:0%
now the moment that I was hoping the
bigger<00:26:04.880><c> piece</c><00:26:05.120><c> would</c><00:26:05.320><c> start</c><00:26:05.520><c> to</c><00:26:05.679><c> be</c><00:26:05.880><c> useful</c>

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
bigger piece would start to be useful
 

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.630 align:start position:0%
bigger piece would start to be useful
this<00:26:07.000><c> is</c><00:26:07.240><c> because</c><00:26:07.640><c> with</c><00:26:07.799><c> its</c><00:26:08.000><c> much</c><00:26:08.200><c> larger</c>

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
this is because with its much larger
 

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.830 align:start position:0%
this is because with its much larger
surface<00:26:09.039><c> area</c><00:26:09.760><c> there</c><00:26:09.880><c> would</c><00:26:10.120><c> now</c><00:26:10.279><c> be</c><00:26:10.480><c> a</c><00:26:10.640><c> lot</c>

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
surface area there would now be a lot
 

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.510 align:start position:0%
surface area there would now be a lot
more<00:26:11.200><c> space</c><00:26:11.559><c> for</c><00:26:11.760><c> the</c><00:26:11.919><c> upper</c><00:26:12.200><c> plate</c><00:26:12.480><c> to</c><00:26:12.640><c> sit</c><00:26:12.880><c> on</c>

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
more space for the upper plate to sit on
 

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.029 align:start position:0%
more space for the upper plate to sit on
and<00:26:13.679><c> in</c><00:26:13.960><c> theory</c><00:26:14.960><c> this</c><00:26:15.080><c> should</c><00:26:15.320><c> help</c><00:26:15.640><c> keep</c><00:26:15.840><c> it</c>

00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%

00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:18.389 align:start position:0%
and in theory this should help keep it

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:22.269 align:start position:0%

00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
because I thought the upper plate was
 

00:26:22.279 --> 00:26:25.990 align:start position:0%
because I thought the upper plate was

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:30.350 align:start position:0%
that it was apparently able to tilt I
also<00:26:29.039><c> noticed</c><00:26:29.399><c> that</c><00:26:29.559><c> this</c><00:26:29.679><c> was</c><00:26:29.919><c> happening</c>

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
also noticed that this was happening
 

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.789 align:start position:0%
also noticed that this was happening
when<00:26:30.520><c> I</c><00:26:30.720><c> closely</c><00:26:31.159><c> rewatched</c><00:26:31.720><c> the</c><00:26:31.840><c> footage</c><00:26:32.640><c> and</c>

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:36.070 align:start position:0%
when I closely rewatched the footage and

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
I saw a very subtle but clear tilt right
 

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.669 align:start position:0%
I saw a very subtle but clear tilt right

before things started going wrong it was
 

00:26:38.679 --> 00:26:41.070 align:start position:0%

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
only an extremely small shift and it was
 

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.389 align:start position:0%
only an extremely small shift and it was
probably<00:26:41.440><c> less</c><00:26:41.679><c> than</c><00:26:41.799><c> a</c><00:26:41.960><c> couple</c><00:26:42.279><c> degrees</c><00:26:43.200><c> but</c>

00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
probably less than a couple degrees but
 

00:26:43.399 --> 00:26:45.549 align:start position:0%
probably less than a couple degrees but

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
this would almost definitely cause it to
 

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.190 align:start position:0%
this would almost definitely cause it to
smear<00:26:52.039><c> out</c><00:26:52.960><c> this</c><00:26:53.080><c> was</c><00:26:53.279><c> also</c><00:26:53.640><c> especially</c>

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
smear out this was also especially
 

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.190 align:start position:0%
smear out this was also especially
likely<00:26:54.480><c> to</c><00:26:54.760><c> happen</c><00:26:55.440><c> if</c><00:26:55.559><c> the</c><00:26:55.720><c> piece</c><00:26:56.000><c> was</c>

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
likely to happen if the piece was
 

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.310 align:start position:0%
likely to happen if the piece was

00:26:59.310 --> 00:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
significantly off center like my was and
 

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.549 align:start position:0%
significantly off center like my was and

00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
if the upper plate was forced to just
 

00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:04.190 align:start position:0%
if the upper plate was forced to just

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
balance on a small piece of wood so
 

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.350 align:start position:0%
balance on a small piece of wood so
basically<00:27:04.919><c> the</c><00:27:05.080><c> Tilt</c><00:27:05.399><c> was</c><00:27:05.559><c> the</c><00:27:05.760><c> major</c><00:27:06.200><c> thing</c>

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
basically the Tilt was the major thing
 

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.549 align:start position:0%
basically the Tilt was the major thing
that<00:27:06.480><c> I</c><00:27:06.600><c> was</c><00:27:06.720><c> hoping</c><00:27:06.960><c> to</c><00:27:07.200><c> avoid</c><00:27:07.640><c> here</c><00:27:08.240><c> and</c><00:27:08.399><c> I</c>

00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
that I was hoping to avoid here and I
 

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:10.470 align:start position:0%
that I was hoping to avoid here and I
really<00:27:08.799><c> felt</c><00:27:09.200><c> that</c><00:27:09.360><c> just</c><00:27:09.600><c> using</c><00:27:09.880><c> a</c><00:27:10.039><c> bigger</c>

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
really felt that just using a bigger
 

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.110 align:start position:0%
really felt that just using a bigger

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
piece and centering it perfectly was
 

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.750 align:start position:0%
piece and centering it perfectly was
going<00:27:13.200><c> to</c><00:27:13.399><c> have</c><00:27:13.520><c> a</c><00:27:13.679><c> massive</c><00:27:14.159><c> effect</c><00:27:15.159><c> on</c><00:27:15.399><c> top</c><00:27:15.559><c> of</c>

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
going to have a massive effect on top of
 

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.789 align:start position:0%
going to have a massive effect on top of
this<00:27:16.000><c> though</c><00:27:16.360><c> I</c><00:27:16.559><c> also</c><00:27:16.880><c> decided</c><00:27:17.240><c> to</c><00:27:17.480><c> not</c>

00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
this though I also decided to not
 

00:27:17.799 --> 00:27:21.389 align:start position:0%
this though I also decided to not
preheat<00:27:18.279><c> the</c><00:27:18.399><c> plates</c><00:27:18.760><c> to</c><00:27:19.080><c> 100°</c><00:27:19.799><c> C</c><00:27:20.799><c> and</c><00:27:20.919><c> to</c><00:27:21.120><c> try</c>

00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
preheat the plates to 100° C and to try
 

00:27:21.399 --> 00:27:23.830 align:start position:0%
preheat the plates to 100° C and to try
squishing<00:27:21.840><c> the</c><00:27:21.960><c> wood</c><00:27:22.320><c> much</c><00:27:22.520><c> more</c><00:27:22.760><c> slowly</c><00:27:23.760><c> I</c>

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
squishing the wood much more slowly I
 

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.549 align:start position:0%
squishing the wood much more slowly I
figured<00:27:24.200><c> this</c><00:27:24.279><c> would</c><00:27:24.480><c> give</c><00:27:24.640><c> the</c><00:27:24.799><c> water</c><00:27:25.200><c> a</c><00:27:25.360><c> lot</c>

00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
figured this would give the water a lot
 

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:27.789 align:start position:0%
figured this would give the water a lot
more<00:27:25.799><c> time</c><00:27:26.000><c> to</c><00:27:26.159><c> get</c><00:27:26.360><c> pushed</c><00:27:26.640><c> out</c><00:27:27.200><c> and</c><00:27:27.399><c> avoid</c>

00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:27.799 align:start position:0%
more time to get pushed out and avoid
 

00:27:27.799 --> 00:27:29.430 align:start position:0%
more time to get pushed out and avoid
any<00:27:28.200><c> weird</c><00:27:28.480><c> internal</c><00:27:28.960><c> pressure</c><00:27:29.279><c> from</c>

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
any weird internal pressure from
 

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.630 align:start position:0%
any weird internal pressure from

building up and potentially damaging the
wood<00:27:32.480><c> and</c><00:27:32.640><c> so</c><00:27:32.960><c> far</c><00:27:33.840><c> things</c><00:27:34.039><c> were</c><00:27:34.240><c> going</c><00:27:34.520><c> pretty</c>

00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
wood and so far things were going pretty
 

00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:36.909 align:start position:0%
wood and so far things were going pretty
well<00:27:35.520><c> it</c><00:27:35.679><c> looked</c><00:27:35.880><c> like</c><00:27:36.000><c> it</c><00:27:36.159><c> was</c><00:27:36.480><c> basically</c>

00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:36.919 align:start position:0%
well it looked like it was basically
 

00:27:36.919 --> 00:27:39.110 align:start position:0%
well it looked like it was basically
just<00:27:37.080><c> getting</c><00:27:37.559><c> thinner</c><00:27:38.559><c> and</c><00:27:38.760><c> that</c><00:27:38.880><c> was</c>

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
just getting thinner and that was
 

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.950 align:start position:0%
just getting thinner and that was
exactly<00:27:39.559><c> what</c><00:27:39.679><c> I</c><00:27:39.760><c> was</c><00:27:39.960><c> hoping</c><00:27:40.360><c> for</c><00:27:41.360><c> as</c><00:27:41.480><c> I</c><00:27:41.679><c> kept</c>

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what I was hoping for as I kept
 

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.950 align:start position:0%
exactly what I was hoping for as I kept
going<00:27:42.360><c> though</c><00:27:42.679><c> it</c><00:27:42.840><c> unfortunately</c><00:27:43.519><c> started</c><00:27:43.840><c> to</c>

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
going though it unfortunately started to
 

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.389 align:start position:0%
going though it unfortunately started to
spread<00:27:44.320><c> out</c><00:27:44.440><c> at</c><00:27:44.600><c> the</c><00:27:44.840><c> bottom</c><00:27:45.840><c> and</c><00:27:46.000><c> it</c><00:27:46.159><c> didn't</c>

00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
spread out at the bottom and it didn't
 

00:27:46.399 --> 00:27:48.750 align:start position:0%
spread out at the bottom and it didn't
seem<00:27:46.640><c> like</c><00:27:46.760><c> I</c><00:27:46.880><c> could</c><00:27:47.000><c> do</c><00:27:47.200><c> anything</c><00:27:47.519><c> to</c><00:27:47.760><c> stop</c><00:27:48.000><c> it</c>

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
seem like I could do anything to stop it
 

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.029 align:start position:0%
seem like I could do anything to stop it
going<00:27:49.039><c> even</c><00:27:49.320><c> slower</c><00:27:49.919><c> didn't</c><00:27:50.200><c> seem</c><00:27:50.399><c> to</c><00:27:50.559><c> do</c><00:27:50.760><c> much</c>

00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
going even slower didn't seem to do much
 

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.750 align:start position:0%
going even slower didn't seem to do much
either<00:27:51.640><c> and</c><00:27:51.760><c> when</c><00:27:51.880><c> I</c><00:27:52.000><c> looked</c><00:27:52.279><c> over</c><00:27:52.440><c> at</c><00:27:52.600><c> the</c>

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
either and when I looked over at the
 

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.029 align:start position:0%
either and when I looked over at the
side<00:27:52.919><c> of</c><00:27:53.080><c> it</c><00:27:53.960><c> I</c><00:27:54.080><c> saw</c><00:27:54.440><c> something</c><00:27:54.880><c> horrible</c><00:27:55.880><c> it</c>

00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
side of it I saw something horrible it
 

00:27:56.039 --> 00:27:57.830 align:start position:0%
side of it I saw something horrible it
had<00:27:56.279><c> also</c><00:27:56.519><c> started</c><00:27:56.840><c> to</c><00:27:56.960><c> roll</c><00:27:57.320><c> over</c><00:27:57.559><c> onto</c>

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
had also started to roll over onto
 

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.470 align:start position:0%
had also started to roll over onto
itself<00:27:58.600><c> just</c><00:27:58.760><c> like</c><00:27:58.960><c> the</c><00:27:59.120><c> first</c><00:27:59.440><c> time</c><00:28:00.200><c> but</c><00:28:00.320><c> it</c>

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
itself just like the first time but it
 

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.990 align:start position:0%
itself just like the first time but it
didn't<00:28:00.720><c> seem</c><00:28:01.000><c> nearly</c><00:28:01.399><c> as</c><00:28:01.760><c> severe</c><00:28:02.760><c> and</c><00:28:02.880><c> I</c>

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
didn't seem nearly as severe and I
 

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.669 align:start position:0%
didn't seem nearly as severe and I
figured<00:28:03.320><c> that</c><00:28:03.399><c> it</c><00:28:03.519><c> was</c><00:28:03.799><c> probably</c><00:28:04.399><c> okay</c><00:28:05.399><c> so</c><00:28:05.559><c> I</c>

00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
figured that it was probably okay so I
 

00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:08.190 align:start position:0%
figured that it was probably okay so I
just<00:28:05.840><c> kept</c><00:28:06.039><c> on</c><00:28:06.320><c> going</c><00:28:07.039><c> and</c><00:28:07.240><c> eventually</c><00:28:08.039><c> it</c>

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
just kept on going and eventually it
 

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.389 align:start position:0%
just kept on going and eventually it
seemed<00:28:08.519><c> like</c><00:28:08.640><c> the</c><00:28:08.760><c> wood</c><00:28:09.000><c> had</c><00:28:09.200><c> hit</c><00:28:09.360><c> its</c><00:28:09.559><c> limit</c>

00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
seemed like the wood had hit its limit
 

00:28:10.399 --> 00:28:12.950 align:start position:0%
seemed like the wood had hit its limit
and<00:28:10.600><c> instead</c><00:28:10.919><c> of</c><00:28:11.120><c> getting</c><00:28:11.519><c> denser</c><00:28:12.519><c> it</c><00:28:12.640><c> was</c>

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
and instead of getting denser it was
 

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.710 align:start position:0%
and instead of getting denser it was
just<00:28:13.159><c> squishing</c><00:28:13.640><c> out</c><00:28:13.840><c> on</c><00:28:13.960><c> the</c><00:28:14.399><c> sides</c><00:28:15.399><c> at</c><00:28:15.559><c> this</c>

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
just squishing out on the sides at this
 

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.669 align:start position:0%
just squishing out on the sides at this

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
anything about this I also suddenly
 

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.310 align:start position:0%
anything about this I also suddenly

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:33.149 align:start position:0%
versions of their press and this made me

start to think that this whole time they
 

00:33:33.159 --> 00:33:35.110 align:start position:0%
start to think that this whole time they

00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%

no on the bright side I had actually hit
it<00:42:07.920><c> but</c><00:42:08.040><c> on</c><00:42:08.200><c> the</c><00:42:08.359><c> sad</c><00:42:08.839><c> side</c><00:42:09.680><c> it</c><00:42:09.800><c> was</c><00:42:10.160><c> pretty</c>

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
it but on the sad side it was pretty
 

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.150 align:start position:0%
it but on the sad side it was pretty
clear<00:42:10.800><c> that</c><00:42:10.920><c> a</c><00:42:11.040><c> real</c><00:42:11.440><c> gun</c><00:42:12.319><c> was</c><00:42:12.640><c> way</c><00:42:12.800><c> more</c>

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
clear that a real gun was way more
 

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:17.470 align:start position:0%
clear that a real gun was way more
powerful<00:42:13.599><c> than</c><00:42:13.720><c> a</c><00:42:13.880><c> pellet</c><00:42:14.480><c> gun</c><00:42:15.480><c> yeah</c><00:42:15.839><c> that</c><00:42:16.480><c> uh</c>

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
powerful than a pellet gun yeah that uh
 

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.790 align:start position:0%
powerful than a pellet gun yeah that uh
that<00:42:17.640><c> didn't</c>

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
that didn't
 

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.790 align:start position:0%
that didn't
work<00:42:19.800><c> just</c><00:42:19.960><c> like</c><00:42:20.160><c> the</c><00:42:20.319><c> very</c><00:42:20.559><c> first</c><00:42:20.880><c> attempt</c><00:42:21.640><c> it</c>

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
work just like the very first attempt it
 

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.630 align:start position:0%
work just like the very first attempt it
also<00:42:22.280><c> kind</c><00:42:22.440><c> of</c><00:42:22.599><c> looked</c><00:42:22.880><c> like</c><00:42:23.000><c> the</c><00:42:23.160><c> back</c><00:42:23.319><c> of</c><00:42:23.440><c> it</c>

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
also kind of looked like the back of it
 

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.109 align:start position:0%
also kind of looked like the back of it
had<00:42:23.800><c> just</c><00:42:24.359><c> exploded</c><00:42:25.359><c> and</c><00:42:25.520><c> that</c><00:42:25.680><c> it</c><00:42:25.839><c> hadn't</c>

00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
had just exploded and that it hadn't
 

00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:27.950 align:start position:0%
had just exploded and that it hadn't
even<00:42:26.319><c> stood</c><00:42:26.599><c> a</c><00:42:26.720><c> chance</c>

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
even stood a chance
 

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.829 align:start position:0%
even stood a chance
this<00:42:28.079><c> was</c><00:42:28.480><c> definitely</c><00:42:29.040><c> not</c><00:42:29.240><c> the</c><00:42:29.400><c> result</c><00:42:29.720><c> that</c>

00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
this was definitely not the result that
 

00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:32.829 align:start position:0%
this was definitely not the result that
I<00:42:29.960><c> was</c><00:42:30.160><c> hoping</c><00:42:30.839><c> for</c><00:42:31.839><c> and</c><00:42:32.000><c> I</c><00:42:32.119><c> was</c><00:42:32.319><c> genuinely</c>

00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:32.839 align:start position:0%
I was hoping for and I was genuinely
 

00:42:32.839 --> 00:42:36.190 align:start position:0%
I was hoping for and I was genuinely
feeling<00:42:33.280><c> pretty</c><00:42:33.599><c> sad</c><00:42:33.880><c> about</c><00:42:34.440><c> it</c><00:42:35.440><c> okay</c><00:42:36.040><c> that's</c>

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
feeling pretty sad about it okay that's
 

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.589 align:start position:0%
feeling pretty sad about it okay that's
it<00:42:36.359><c> let's</c><00:42:36.559><c> go</c>

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
it let's go
 

00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:41.150 align:start position:0%
it let's go
home<00:42:39.599><c> when</c><00:42:39.760><c> I</c><00:42:39.880><c> got</c><00:42:40.160><c> back</c><00:42:40.480><c> though</c><00:42:40.760><c> I</c><00:42:40.839><c> was</c><00:42:40.960><c> able</c>

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
home when I got back though I was able
 

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.270 align:start position:0%
home when I got back though I was able
to<00:42:41.319><c> clean</c><00:42:41.559><c> it</c><00:42:41.720><c> up</c><00:42:42.079><c> and</c><00:42:42.240><c> take</c><00:42:42.400><c> a</c><00:42:42.559><c> better</c><00:42:42.839><c> look</c><00:42:43.040><c> at</c>

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
to clean it up and take a better look at
 

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.950 align:start position:0%
to clean it up and take a better look at
it<00:42:44.079><c> and</c><00:42:44.240><c> I</c><00:42:44.400><c> realized</c><00:42:44.800><c> it</c><00:42:45.000><c> wasn't</c><00:42:45.400><c> actually</c><00:42:45.760><c> as</c>

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
it and I realized it wasn't actually as
 

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.630 align:start position:0%
it and I realized it wasn't actually as
bad<00:42:46.160><c> as</c><00:42:46.280><c> I</c><00:42:46.440><c> thought</c><00:42:47.280><c> I</c><00:42:47.359><c> mean</c><00:42:47.880><c> it</c><00:42:48.000><c> still</c><00:42:48.240><c> wasn't</c>

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
bad as I thought I mean it still wasn't
 

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.790 align:start position:0%
bad as I thought I mean it still wasn't
ideal<00:42:49.240><c> and</c><00:42:49.359><c> the</c><00:42:49.480><c> bullet</c><00:42:49.800><c> had</c><00:42:50.040><c> clearly</c><00:42:50.480><c> gone</c>

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
ideal and the bullet had clearly gone
 

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.430 align:start position:0%
ideal and the bullet had clearly gone
right<00:42:51.000><c> through</c><00:42:51.359><c> it</c><00:42:51.960><c> but</c><00:42:52.119><c> what</c><00:42:52.280><c> was</c><00:42:52.480><c> important</c>

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
right through it but what was important
 

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.510 align:start position:0%
right through it but what was important
was<00:42:53.599><c> that</c><00:42:53.760><c> it</c><00:42:54.000><c> hadn't</c><00:42:54.359><c> just</c><00:42:54.680><c> catastrophically</c>

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
was that it hadn't just catastrophically
 

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.549 align:start position:0%
was that it hadn't just catastrophically
exploded<00:42:56.040><c> it</c><00:42:56.880><c> in</c><00:42:57.200><c> instead</c><00:42:57.960><c> it</c><00:42:58.079><c> looked</c><00:42:58.319><c> like</c><00:42:58.440><c> it</c>

00:42:58.549 --> 00:42:58.559 align:start position:0%
exploded it in instead it looked like it
 

00:42:58.559 --> 00:43:00.829 align:start position:0%
exploded it in instead it looked like it
had<00:42:58.720><c> been</c><00:42:59.040><c> sequentially</c><00:42:59.720><c> peeled</c><00:43:00.160><c> back</c><00:43:00.319><c> in</c>

00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
had been sequentially peeled back in
 

00:43:00.839 --> 00:43:03.150 align:start position:0%
had been sequentially peeled back in
layers<00:43:01.839><c> and</c><00:43:01.960><c> it</c><00:43:02.119><c> didn't</c><00:43:02.359><c> even</c><00:43:02.599><c> seem</c><00:43:02.839><c> like</c><00:43:03.040><c> much</c>

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
layers and it didn't even seem like much
 

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.549 align:start position:0%
layers and it didn't even seem like much
of<00:43:03.319><c> the</c><00:43:03.440><c> wood</c><00:43:03.680><c> had</c><00:43:03.800><c> been</c><00:43:04.240><c> removed</c><00:43:05.240><c> it</c><00:43:05.359><c> also</c>

00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
of the wood had been removed it also
 

00:43:05.559 --> 00:43:07.109 align:start position:0%
of the wood had been removed it also
seemed<00:43:05.839><c> like</c><00:43:06.000><c> if</c><00:43:06.079><c> I</c><00:43:06.200><c> pushed</c><00:43:06.480><c> on</c><00:43:06.599><c> it</c><00:43:06.839><c> hard</c>

00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
seemed like if I pushed on it hard
 

00:43:07.119 --> 00:43:09.230 align:start position:0%
seemed like if I pushed on it hard
enough<00:43:07.640><c> I</c><00:43:07.760><c> could</c><00:43:08.079><c> basically</c><00:43:08.559><c> put</c><00:43:08.680><c> it</c><00:43:08.880><c> back</c>

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
enough I could basically put it back
 

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.510 align:start position:0%
enough I could basically put it back
together<00:43:10.200><c> and</c><00:43:10.319><c> this</c><00:43:10.520><c> made</c><00:43:10.720><c> me</c><00:43:10.920><c> feel</c><00:43:11.160><c> like</c><00:43:11.319><c> it</c>

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
together and this made me feel like it
 

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.430 align:start position:0%
together and this made me feel like it
wasn't<00:43:12.079><c> actually</c><00:43:12.559><c> that</c><00:43:12.720><c> far</c><00:43:12.960><c> off</c><00:43:13.200><c> from</c>

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually that far off from
 

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.950 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually that far off from
stopping<00:43:13.839><c> it</c><00:43:14.839><c> I</c><00:43:15.000><c> really</c><00:43:15.200><c> felt</c><00:43:15.440><c> that</c><00:43:15.599><c> something</c>

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
stopping it I really felt that something
 

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.670 align:start position:0%
stopping it I really felt that something
just<00:43:16.160><c> slightly</c><00:43:16.839><c> stronger</c><00:43:17.240><c> would</c><00:43:17.400><c> have</c><00:43:17.520><c> been</c>

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
just slightly stronger would have been
 

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.589 align:start position:0%
just slightly stronger would have been
able<00:43:17.880><c> to</c><00:43:18.040><c> do</c><00:43:18.240><c> it</c><00:43:18.839><c> and</c><00:43:19.040><c> as</c><00:43:19.280><c> one</c><00:43:19.760><c> final</c><00:43:20.480><c> test</c><00:43:21.480><c> I</c>

00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
able to do it and as one final test I
 

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:24.190 align:start position:0%
able to do it and as one final test I
wanted<00:43:21.880><c> to</c><00:43:22.040><c> try</c><00:43:22.319><c> adding</c><00:43:22.599><c> a</c><00:43:22.760><c> second</c><00:43:23.079><c> layer</c><00:43:24.040><c> this</c>

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to try adding a second layer this
 

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.670 align:start position:0%
wanted to try adding a second layer this
was<00:43:24.480><c> actually</c><00:43:24.800><c> something</c><00:43:25.040><c> that</c><00:43:25.200><c> the</c><00:43:25.319><c> paper</c>

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
was actually something that the paper
 

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.950 align:start position:0%
was actually something that the paper
tested<00:43:26.520><c> and</c><00:43:26.640><c> they</c><00:43:26.760><c> found</c><00:43:26.960><c> that</c><00:43:27.160><c> that</c><00:43:27.319><c> only</c><00:43:27.640><c> one</c>

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
tested and they found that that only one
 

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.790 align:start position:0%
tested and they found that that only one
extra<00:43:28.359><c> layer</c><00:43:28.760><c> could</c><00:43:28.920><c> make</c><00:43:29.040><c> it</c><00:43:29.200><c> over</c><00:43:29.520><c> five</c>

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
extra layer could make it over five
 

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.109 align:start position:0%
extra layer could make it over five
times<00:43:30.359><c> stronger</c><00:43:31.359><c> and</c><00:43:31.480><c> I</c><00:43:31.599><c> felt</c><00:43:31.880><c> that</c><00:43:32.040><c> this</c>

00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
times stronger and I felt that this
 

00:43:32.119 --> 00:43:34.549 align:start position:0%
times stronger and I felt that this
would<00:43:32.280><c> be</c><00:43:32.440><c> more</c><00:43:32.640><c> than</c><00:43:32.839><c> enough</c><00:43:33.839><c> to</c><00:43:34.000><c> try</c><00:43:34.319><c> this</c>

00:43:34.549 --> 00:43:34.559 align:start position:0%
would be more than enough to try this
 

00:43:34.559 --> 00:43:36.150 align:start position:0%
would be more than enough to try this
though<00:43:35.000><c> I</c><00:43:35.119><c> was</c><00:43:35.280><c> of</c><00:43:35.440><c> course</c><00:43:35.680><c> going</c><00:43:35.800><c> to</c><00:43:35.920><c> have</c><00:43:36.040><c> to</c>

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
though I was of course going to have to

00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
it was quite good enough because the
 

00:50:26.839 --> 00:50:29.270 align:start position:0%
it was quite good enough because the

back still got split apart I was

00:55:35.029 --> 00:55:35.039 align:start position:0%
was kind of shockingly

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.789 align:start position:0%
wow with all that being said though this
entire<00:55:44.119><c> project</c><00:55:44.680><c> was</c><00:55:44.920><c> mostly</c><00:55:45.319><c> just</c><00:55:45.480><c> meant</c><00:55:45.680><c> to</c>

00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
entire project was mostly just meant to
 

00:55:45.799 --> 00:55:47.950 align:start position:0%
entire project was mostly just meant to
be<00:55:45.960><c> a</c><00:55:46.079><c> proof</c><00:55:46.280><c> of</c><00:55:46.559><c> concept</c><00:55:47.400><c> and</c><00:55:47.520><c> to</c><00:55:47.680><c> see</c><00:55:47.839><c> if</c>

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
be a proof of concept and to see if
 

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.750 align:start position:0%
be a proof of concept and to see if
wooden<00:55:48.280><c> armor</c><00:55:48.680><c> was</c><00:55:48.839><c> even</c><00:55:49.440><c> possible</c><00:55:50.440><c> and</c><00:55:50.599><c> I</c>

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
wooden armor was even possible and I
 

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:53.349 align:start position:0%
wooden armor was even possible and I
guess<00:55:50.960><c> the</c><00:55:51.079><c> answer</c><00:55:51.359><c> is</c><00:55:51.520><c> that</c><00:55:51.640><c> it</c><00:55:51.839><c> is</c><00:55:52.640><c> I</c><00:55:52.720><c> mean</c><00:55:53.160><c> it</c>

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
guess the answer is that it is I mean it
 

00:55:53.359 --> 00:55:54.910 align:start position:0%
guess the answer is that it is I mean it
still<00:55:53.760><c> definitely</c><00:55:54.200><c> needs</c><00:55:54.480><c> a</c><00:55:54.599><c> lot</c><00:55:54.720><c> of</c>

00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
still definitely needs a lot of
 

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.150 align:start position:0%
still definitely needs a lot of
improvement<00:55:55.680><c> and</c><00:55:55.799><c> this</c><00:55:55.920><c> is</c><00:55:56.079><c> not</c><00:55:56.680><c> anything</c>

00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
improvement and this is not anything
 

00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.589 align:start position:0%

00:55:59.599 --> 00:56:01.990 align:start position:0%
that I would currently want to wear but

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
I think that it has a lot of potential I
 

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.390 align:start position:0%
I think that it has a lot of potential I
also<00:56:02.240><c> think</c><00:56:02.480><c> that</c><00:56:02.599><c> it</c><00:56:02.680><c> could</c><00:56:02.839><c> be</c><00:56:03.079><c> really</c>

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
also think that it could be really
 

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.390 align:start position:0%
also think that it could be really

even Kevlar I genuinely think that it's

even Kevlar I genuinely think that it's

00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
more tasty projects like turning
 

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.710 align:start position:0%

so<00:56:35.039><c> this</c><00:56:35.240><c> project</c><00:56:35.520><c> ended</c><00:56:35.760><c> up</c><00:56:35.920><c> being</c><00:56:36.520><c> a</c><00:56:36.720><c> lot</c>

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
so this project ended up being a lot
 

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.190 align:start position:0%
so this project ended up being a lot

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
more tedious than I initially thought
 

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.950 align:start position:0%
more tedious than I initially thought
and<00:56:39.960><c> ultimately</c><00:56:40.960><c> it</c><00:56:41.079><c> took</c><00:56:41.280><c> a</c><00:56:41.440><c> lot</c><00:56:41.640><c> more</c><00:56:41.839><c> than</c>

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
and ultimately it took a lot more than
 

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.069 align:start position:0%
and ultimately it took a lot more than
just<00:56:42.280><c> chemistry</c><00:56:42.640><c> to</c><00:56:42.799><c> get</c><00:56:42.880><c> it</c><00:56:43.039><c> done</c><00:56:43.760><c> this</c><00:56:43.880><c> is</c>

00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
just chemistry to get it done this is
 

00:56:44.079 --> 00:56:46.270 align:start position:0%
just chemistry to get it done this is
actually<00:56:44.359><c> one</c><00:56:44.480><c> of</c><00:56:44.599><c> the</c><00:56:44.799><c> major</c><00:56:45.200><c> reasons</c><00:56:45.920><c> why</c><00:56:46.079><c> it</c>

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
actually one of the major reasons why it
 

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.549 align:start position:0%
actually one of the major reasons why it
